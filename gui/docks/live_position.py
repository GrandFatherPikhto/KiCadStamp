# gui/docks/live_position.py
"""Shared "read the current live position of a record's referent" resolvers
for the Config Tree forms' "Read current position" buttons (design
2026-08_29_config_tree_read_live_position.md).

The Config Tree forms (Placer coordinate/clone, Rules origin) previously only
let the user TYPE coordinates; this module is the single source of the
"referent -> live position/rotation" step, reused by every form instead of
being duplicated. It deliberately does NOT touch the board for anything other
than reading: pure resolvers over the existing kicadstamp services
(resolve_footprint_by_ref / resolve_footprint_by_role /
resolve_footprint_by_cluster_role / resolve_point_chain /
resolve_roles_by_nets / resolve_roles_by_selection) plus the pure geometry
inverse clone_origin_from_component (clone_geometry.py) for a clone's cell
origin.

No PyQt import here on purpose — this module is unit-testable without a
QApplication (the forms own the buttons/fields/fill-in; this module only
computes). Raises the same fatal ValidationError the underlying resolvers
raise on none/ambiguous — the "never guess silently" principle — and the GUI
handler turns it into a QMessageBox warning."""
